## Overview

### The challenge

The text for the previous period's time should change based on the active timeframe. For Daily, it should read "Yesterday" e.g "Yesterday - 2hrs". For Weekly, it should read "Last Week" e.g. "Last Week - 32hrs". For monthly, it should read "Last Month" e.g. "Last Month - 19hrs".

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- installing tailwind cli
- configuring tailwind
- tailwind animations
- practice refactoring code
- for loops js
- for of loops js
- DOM manipulation


### Continued development
- add DOMContentLoaded for loading the default display
- make the ... buttons to pop up a share/copy button.
  - I already began working on this, but making each card act individually is difficult without a lot of repetition in the code. Also once the popup button is shown on hover, I struggled to remove it once the mouse is moved.
